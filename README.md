Robotic Arm Control System with Arduino
This project combines a 3D robotic arm model with a functional Arduino-based control interface using push buttons. The goal is to simulate and potentially control the movement of a robotic arm using a physical circuit interface.

ðŸ§© 1. 3D Robotic Arm
Designed in: Tinkercad

Structure:

Base with mounting block

4 articulated segments with blue rotational joints

Claw gripper at the end

Use case: Educational, simulation, or servo-controlled robotic arm.


ðŸ”Œ 2. Arduino Push Button Controller
ðŸ’¡ Components:
Arduino Uno

Breadboard

4 Push Buttons

4 Resistors (410Î©) for pull-down configuration


Each button is connected in a pull-down configuration:

One side to ground through a 10kÎ© resistor

One side to +5V through the push button

The signal pin connects to the digital input pins D2â€“D5
